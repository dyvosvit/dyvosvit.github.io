<p><strong><em>2. Listening</em></strong></p>
<p>Tom and Jess both talk about things they could not live without. Listen and do the tasks.</p>
<p>Jess. Right, Tom, tell me, what three things could you not live without?</p>
<p>Tom. Well, I guess you say me playing with my new toy just now. It&rsquo;s my iPod touch and it is fantastic. I often take long bus journeys at the weekend and on this little electronic storage machine with screen I can watch a movie and that&rsquo;s just ... makes bus journeys fly by. It also has wireless internet so I can carry it around and in a coffee shop I can check my e-mail and it has the added function of being able to play music, although I don&rsquo;t listen to music much. That&rsquo;s one. My iPod touch is with me all the time. It&rsquo;s kind of connected to my number 2. Number 2 is the internet. I couldn&rsquo;t live without the internet. I&rsquo;m online every day &mdash; reading new papers, checking out information about things I want to do and see that day. Keeping in touch with family and friends, although I don&rsquo;t do that as much as they would like. The internet is such a huge part of my life. I can&rsquo;t imagine what it was like ten or fifteen years ago, when nobody was online. Number three, I suppose is the sun, which sounds a bit facile because everything on the whole planet requires the sun, but for me it&rsquo;s not so much about the nutrition that plants and animals derive from the sun. It&rsquo;s just being able to lie and relax in the soft warmth, tanning by the pool letting my mind empty and clear. Those are my three. How about you?</p>
<p>Jess. Well, I have to agree with your second one, definitely the Internet is one thing couldn&rsquo;t live without either, for the same reasons you mentioned, really, just to stay in touch with people for things like reading the news, checking my e-mail, finding phone numbers, getting information. I really couldn&rsquo;t live without it. The second thing would be my family. I couldn&rsquo;t live without them. I think since I&rsquo;ve moved away from Britain and I don&rsquo;t live close to them, and I don&rsquo;t see them regularly anymore, I&rsquo;ve grown to love them even more. Kind of you don&rsquo;t realize what you&rsquo;ve until it&rsquo;s gone, and that was true with my family. I really miss them all the time, and I love going back to see them, so they&rsquo;re my number two, and my number three would be music. Music&rsquo;s a huge part of my life and I think I remember things by what I was listening to at the time. I&rsquo;ll remember periods of my life by what&rsquo;s songs I was listening to or what album&nbsp;і&nbsp;bought, so for me my memories are very much brought back to me by music, so those are my three things: the Internet, my family, and music.</p>
